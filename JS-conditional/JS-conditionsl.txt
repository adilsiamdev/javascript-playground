When to use Conditionals:

Use if to specify a code block to be executed, if a specified condition is true
Use else to specify a code block to be executed, if the same condition is false
Use else if to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false
Use switch to specify many alternative code blocks to be executed
Use (? :) (ternary) as a shorthand for if...else
