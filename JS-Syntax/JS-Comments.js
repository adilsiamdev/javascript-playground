//Single Line Comments
//Single line comments start with //.

//Any text between // and the end of the line will be ignored by JavaScript (will not be executed).

//This example uses a single-line comment before each code line:

// Change heading:
document.getElementById("myH").innerHTML = "My First Page";

// Change paragraph:
document.getElementById("myP").innerHTML = "My first paragraph.";


//Multi-line Comments
//Multi-line comments start with /* and end with */.

//Any text between /* and */ will be ignored by JavaScript.

//This example uses a multi-line comment (a comment block) to explain the code:

/*
The code below will change
the heading with id = "myH"
and the paragraph with id = "myP"
in my web page:
*/
document.getElementById("myH").innerHTML = "My First Page";
document.getElementById("myP").innerHTML = "My first paragraph.";
